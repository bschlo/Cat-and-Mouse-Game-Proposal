## Project Choice: 

Cat and Mouse game

## Project Description:

My app is called Cat and Mouse. The object of the game is for the user (mouse) to touch all 9 squares before getting caught by the computer (cat). The cat and mouse can move to any box. You must outsmart the cat in order to win.

## Rules:

The mouse and cat start on opposite corners of a 3 x 3 board.
From there, the user can choose to move to any square. The computer will simultaneously choose a direction to move in. 
From the next position, the user must choose a position to move in. 
In order to win, the user must touch all 9 squares. 
If the cat and mouse are on the same position, then the cat wins and the user loses.
